"""An API, or application programming interface, is an interface which, to put it generally, allows a user to send data to an application from another, or receive
data in an application from another. The Blue Alliance has an API called TBA API that can be used to request data about FRC. The data is returned in a format called
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), which is converted to a native Python object with nested data (lists, dictionaries, etc.), making the data easy to process and use.

To get the data, this program uses the requests module. The requests module is not a default module and has to be installed using pip, but the module makes API
requests easier to make and is an easy, one-time install."""

"""API authentication key is stored as a program argument that is included in sys.argv at the program's start. Storing the key in the program would make the key accessible to others
if pushed to a git repository, so the better way to access the key is to store it as a program argument. The program arguments are stored as a list, the first item
of which is always the file path for the program since the only additional argument is the API key, the index of the key will be 1 as it is the second item."""
